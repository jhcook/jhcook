## Hi there 👋

Engineering Leader • Distributed Systems • Agentic AI • Reliability & Automation • Telemetry & Visibility

I design and operate large-scale distributed systems and build the automation ecosystems that keep them reliable, observable, and fast. My work blends 30 years of hands-on engineering with a growing focus on agentic AI, Kubernetes platform engineering, and intelligent automation pipelines.

I’ve led global engineering teams across the US, UK, Russia, and Australia, delivering cloud-native transformations, SRE programs, and high-availability platforms for finance, energy, SaaS, and government.

My current obsession: building systems that reason about their own state and augment human operators, instead of just automating tasks.

🚀 Current Focus Areas

Distributed Systems Engineering
Kubernetes, AWS, multi-cluster architectures, IaC, reliability tooling, observability design.

Agentic AI & Automation
Multi-agent frameworks, RAG systems, telemetry-aware LLMs, AI-driven operational workflows, custom GPT tooling.

Platform Modernisation
CI/CD transformations, cloud migration strategy, zero-downtime data upgrades, threat-aware network design.

SRE & Operational Excellence
Incident automation, resiliency patterns, governance, cross-team enablement.

🌏 Background in Brief

I’ve built and led engineering teams for finance, energy, and government; delivered global cloud-native transformations; enforced high-stakes compliance (SOC2, NERC CIP); and architected platforms trusted by millions of users. I enjoy the intersection where system architecture, leadership, and intelligent automation collide.
