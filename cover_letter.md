## About Me

I’ve spent my career building and operating the systems that other people depend on — the ones that can’t go down, can’t drift, and can’t hide their own state. My path began long before “cloud-native” was a phrase, in environments where reliability wasn’t a goal so much as a requirement: military networks, early trading infrastructure, and high-volume data systems that had to survive regardless of who was on call.

That grounding shaped how I think about engineering. Distributed systems aren’t just software; they’re living, breathing ecosystems of machines, humans, expectations, and failure domains. They evolve, they misbehave, and they surprise you. My job over the years has been to give those systems the right architecture, tooling, and guardrails so they stay resilient and understandable — even as they scale or shift underneath us.

I’ve worked across four countries and multiple industries: defence, finance, energy, government, and SaaS. Each environment taught its own lessons about failure, coordination, observability, and complexity. Whether I was leading global platform teams, migrating legacy stacks into Kubernetes, or coaching engineers through modern SRE practices, the through-line was always the same: build systems that are clear, intelligent, and predictable under pressure.

In recent years, my focus has been drifting — by choice — toward the frontier where reliability engineering meets agentic AI. Automation has always been about eliminating toil, but intelligent automation offers something more: systems that can contextualize their own behaviour. Telemetry that can explain itself. Pipelines that can reason about drift. Incident tooling that can summarize state, correlate signals, and surface meaning rather than raw noise.

That curiosity is what drives the open-source projects I maintain. Some are practical — a reproducible Kubernetes development environment designed to mirror the realities of enterprise clusters. Others explore how agents can coordinate, retrieve information, and act as first-class tools in an engineering workflow. A few stretch into media-AI pipelines, simply because modern generative systems make it possible to prototype ideas that once required whole teams.

What ties them together isn’t the tech stack — it’s the desire to understand and improve how complex systems behave, both operationally and cognitively.

My work today sits somewhere between platform engineering, SRE leadership, and applied AI research. I’m still deeply hands-on: writing code, instrumenting pipelines, standing up clusters, shaping architectures with my teams. But I’m equally invested in the cultural side of engineering — clarity, mentorship, psychological safety, and decision-making that matches business reality rather than fashion.

I believe the future belongs to systems that remain dependable while becoming more autonomous — not automated in the old sense, but aware, explanatory, and collaborative. My goal is to help build that future: platforms that scale, teams that thrive, and infrastructure that becomes more helpful the more complex it gets.

If any of that resonates with you — whether you’re working on distributed systems, reliability, or the next generation of intelligent agents — feel free to reach out. I’m always open to conversations, collaborations, or simply comparing notes on what it means to build systems that last.
